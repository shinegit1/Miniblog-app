### Process
The website environment which is meant for public. This contains the user data.
- Git clone `https://github.com/shinegit1/miniblog-app.git`
- To apply the migrations: `py manage.py migrate`
- To create a superuser: `py manage.py createsuperuser`
- To run the website: `py manage.py runserver`

This is my first project. It is not deploy in server. If you want to add more features and to design it 
as you desired, it is free to use for the public.

Thank you.
